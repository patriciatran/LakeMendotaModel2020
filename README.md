# Lake Mendota Model

The purpose of this directory is to keep track of my files for the "Lake Mendota Modeling 2020" project. The objective is to calibrate and run a genome-informed microbial model.

# Data collection

## Field Data
Data was collection in Lake Mendota during the 2020 year. 

## Microbial and Viral Data

### Metagenomics
30 samples were selected for DNA extraction at the JGI. 16 bacterial samples were extracted using the standard Qiagen Powerlyzer Powersoil extraction kit. The viral samples were obtained by fixing the filtered water with FeCl, then filtering onto a filter, then following the Qiagen Powerlyzer Powersoil extraction kit as per the manufacturer's instructins.

### Metatranscriptomics
